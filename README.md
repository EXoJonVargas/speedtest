Internet Speed Test Using IP Address
Code Explanation

The provided code defines a simple internet speed test function using the speedtest library. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works:

Importing the Library: We start by importing the speedtest module, which provides the necessary functions to perform speed tests.

Defining the Function: The speed_test function takes an optional parameter ip_address. If an IP address is provided, the function will attempt to find the best server based on that IP.

Getting the Best Server: The get_best_server() method is called to select the optimal server for testing. This is crucial for accurate results.

Testing Download Speed: The download() method measures the download speed, which is then converted from bits per second to megabits per second (Mbps) for easier interpretation.

Testing Upload Speed: Similarly, the upload() method measures the upload speed, also converted to Mbps.

Output: Finally, the results are printed to the console, displaying both the download and upload speeds formatted to two decimal places.

Main Block: The script includes a main block that allows it to be run as a standalone program. You can replace '8.8.8.8' with any desired IP address to test the speed against that specific server.

This script provides a straightforward way to measure internet speed, making it a valuable tool for both personal and professional use.
